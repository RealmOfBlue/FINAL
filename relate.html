<h1>The Indicator</h1>
<p>Let's talk about the test itself...</p>
<p>"MBTI" stands for "Myer's Briggs Type Indicator."
        The indicator is an important tool for determining types.
        It's far from the only way to 
        discover your type, but it IS a great place to start.
        </p>

    <p> It’s important to understand that socionics has a 
        separate identity from Myer’s Briggs. Both are built off 
        Jung’s principles (ie., the original eight types), but 
        they differ slightly in theory. 
        Because they’re derived from the same material ultimately, 
        they are often compared or used in conjunction with one another. 
        Socionics differs from Myer’s Briggs when it comes to the function 
        stack—but the main difference that many typology nerds focus on is 
        the emphasis socionics puts on typology and relationships. 
        Here’s an example of a theoretical compatibility chart made with 
        both Myer’s Briggs and socionics in mind!</p>

        <p>
            (Note: the types used in socionics are extremely similar 
            to those in Myer’s Briggs—but as they’re technically separate,
             the personalities are written out differently. </p>

        Some Favorite Pairings Within the MBTI Community: </p> <p>

    
        ISFJ x ENTP </p> <p>
        
        INTJ x INTP </p>
        <p>

        INFJ x INFP</p> <p>
        
        ISTP x ISFP</p> <p>

           <h2>“Golden Pairs” or “Ideal Matches”</h2>
           <p>
           

These selections are usually determined by compatibility rather than
 aesthetic or appeal in fiction. The focus is on “what’s best for you” 
 and how well the types tend to work as a team. You’ll likely notice a 
 common theme here: introverts with extroverts, sensors with 
 sensors/intuitives with intuitives, perceivers with judgers, and a 
 thinking/feeing tossup. This is because introverts and extroverts are 
 naturally drawn to each other, a decision-maker or a “leader” is
  beneficial and S/N communication is on average harder than N/N or S/S.
   Typically, when trying to guess at real couples, the most sure thing to 
   bet on is Thinking and Feeling both being present—Feeling manifesting as
    feminine and Thinking manifesting as masculine; the reason being that 
    societal norms and the correlation between type and gender can play a 
    big role in matchmaking. </p> <p>
